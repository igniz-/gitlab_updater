# gitlab_updater
Small script to update gitlab by downloading the latest package (ubuntu, but can be easily modified for other distros)

See comments in the file for instructions.

Just put it in your crontab, I'll just add a line at the beginning with a cd to the directory where the packages will be downloaded, just to be more organised.
